//! The keyboard focus on views that are not text fields: `focus()` moves
//! it to a stop ([`nsh_core::ViewProps::focus_stop`]), as on macOS, Linux
//! and the web. A focused stop reports `FOCUSED`, `onFocus` and `onBlur`;
//! its keys reach the app's keymap (bound while it has the focus) as with
//! no field focused, but for Return and Space, which only the focus' own
//! bindings take (`Keymap::find_at`); else they press it.
//!
//! The focus leaves the stop when a field takes it, on `blur()`, when the
//! pointer goes down outside the stop, or when the stop goes away.
