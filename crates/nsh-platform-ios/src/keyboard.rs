//! Hardware keys on the focused view: the `on_key_down` / `on_key_up`
//! notifications a focusable view and its ancestors hear, the mounted
//! capture rules that decide whether a key runs a default, and Tab's focus
//! traversal.
//!
//! UIKit delivers a key to the first responder as `UIPress`es
//! ([`crate::native_view::NshView`] overrides `pressesBegan:withEvent:`,
//! `pressesChanged:withEvent:`, `pressesEnded:withEvent:` and
//! `pressesCancelled:withEvent:`). A focused view reports one
//! [`KeyEvent`](nsh_core::KeyEvent) per transition and lets the engine
//! bubble it to the listening ancestors in its window; an ancestor that is
//! not the first responder reports nothing itself. Listeners and capture
//! rules are read from the mounter's metadata for the focused node and
//! every logical ancestor (a scroll view included), stopping at a modal's
//! window boundary as the core's bubbling does. A portaled view (an
//! `Overlay`, whose native Insert is at the root) uses the core's
//! `ViewProps::key_parent` override for these walks; its layout and
//! hit-testing parent stays the native one.
//!
//! The app's shortcuts ([`crate::keymap`]) keep their precedence: a press
//! they consume never becomes a raw notification. Otherwise the mounted
//! capture rules of the focused view and its enabled ancestors decide
//! whether the key runs a default ([`KeyEvent::default_prevented`]). A
//! captured key still notifies. Tab and Shift+Tab move the keyboard focus
//! between the focus stops (inputs and `focusable` views) unless a rule
//! captures them or the app's keymap binds them; Return and Space press a
//! focused view that takes presses, as the other backends do.
//!
//! What the source gives:
//!
//! - The physical identity is `UIKey.keyCode`, the USB HID usage. UIKit
//!   has no DOM code of its own, so [`dom_code`] maps the HID usage to the
//!   DOM's `KeyboardEvent.code` spelling (the key's place: `"KeyA"` for
//!   the usage under `A`, whatever the layout types there). A usage this
//!   backend has no DOM code for reports `""`, never a guess from the
//!   character.
//! - The logical key is the character the source reports for this press
//!   (`UIKey.characters`: its case, Shift and layout included, so Shift+A
//!   is `"A"`, a US keyboard's Shift+/ is `"?"`, and a German or Cyrillic
//!   key keeps its own character). Only a chord whose `characters` is no
//!   printable text (Control's `\u{1}`, an empty composition) falls back
//!   to `UIKey.charactersIgnoringModifiers`, the layout's unmodified
//!   character; never to a US layout guess. Named keys (`Enter`, `Escape`,
//!   `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `ArrowLeft`, `F1`, `Shift`, ...) keep
//!   the DOM's spelling. Capture matching canonicalizes through the same
//!   `keymap::keystroke` the app's shortcuts use, so a layout's reported
//!   character wins over its HID position on both sides (a French `a` on
//!   the US `q` key captures `a`, not `q`).
//! - UIKit delivers a held key's press once and reports no auto-repeat:
//!   `repeat` is always false here, and `pressesChanged:` (whose keyboard
//!   transitions UIKit does not document) reports nothing. An app that
//!   wants repeats starts its own timer from the press.
//!
//! Tab has two paths. While no view or input has the focus, the surface
//! root is the first responder ([`crate::surface::RootView`]): a Tab it
//! receives at `pressesBegan:` moves to the first stop and Shift+Tab to the
//! last ([`root_tab`]) through the same walk of visible focus stops that a
//! focused view uses. A focusable view also answers `canBecomeFocused`, so
//! UIKit's focus engine and `didUpdateFocusInContext:` follow the same
//! items. On a focused view, a Tab an app shortcut binds or a mounted rule
//! captures returns `UIKeyCommand`s with `wantsPriorityOverSystemBehavior`
//! for exactly those modifier combinations: the app's Tab binding runs
//! first, then the capture keeps the key (an uncaptured, unbound Tab follows
//! the normal traversal). A Tab delivered by that command has no `UIPress`:
//! its `KeyDown` has `code: ""`, `repeat: false`, and no `KeyUp` is
//! invented. Command+Tab is the system's app switcher and is never
//! intercepted.
//!
//! Blur, cancellation and deactivation clear the keys a view holds without
//! synthesizing a release: the source delivered no `pressesEnded:`, so no
//! `KeyUp` is invented. A real release that arrives after the focus moved
//! is reported on the view that has the focus then (the DOM's behavior).
//!
//! A focused view that blurs (`ref.blur()`) or is deleted leaves UIKit
//! without a first responder; UIKit does not make the window's root one. On
//! the next turn [`root_focus_if_none`] gives the surface root the keyboard
//! back only where no view in the window is first responder, so a transfer
//! to a native input, a hosted view or another custom view keeps its focus.
//! A modal's view is its own scope and is never replaced by the background
//! surface root.
