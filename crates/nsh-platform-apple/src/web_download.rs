//! A `WKWebView`'s downloads, shared by the macOS and iOS backends: WebKit's
//! `WKDownload` is the transfer, and the core decides every download's
//! destination, cancellation and lifetime.
//!
//! A navigation delegate turns a navigation into a download
//! ([`is_download`] for a response, [`should_download`] for an action) and
//! hands WebKit's `WKDownload` to [`Transport::adopt`]. WebKit then asks the
//! transport for a destination; the transport reports the offer
//! (`EventKind::DownloadOffer`) from that callback, where the response's MIME
//! type, declared size, final URL and suggested name are known, and holds
//! WebKit's completion handler until the core answers with
//! [`Transport::start`] (write into this path) or [`Transport::cancel`]
//! (write nothing). The finish and failure callbacks report
//! `EventKind::DownloadEnd`.
//!
//! This crate never decides a state, names a destination or touches a file
//! policy: staging and publication are `nsh-core`'s. It creates no file —
//! WebKit creates the staging leaf the core named — and it deletes none. The
//! only file system access is one `metadata` of a finished staging file, to
//! report its size.
//!
//! All callbacks arrive on the main thread, where the transport and its
//! `WKDownloadDelegate` live. Every native block holds only the transport's
//! state, never a host, and reports continue after the web view is released
//! (the core's teardown needs the stop confirmation to clean its staging
//! directory).
