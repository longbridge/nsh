//! The download state machine: sessions, effects, deadlines and replies.
//!
//! Everything here runs on the engine thread. File work goes through
//! [`Io`], a thread of its own (off WebAssembly), and comes back as
//! [`Signal`]s that [`Downloads::poll`] applies in order. The core never
//! waits for a disk, and a publish and a cancel cannot interleave: whichever
//! the core applies first decides the download, the other is refused with
//! `ERR_NSH_DOWNLOAD_STATE`.
//!
//! A cancellation's answer and its terminal event wait for the platform to
//! confirm its writer stopped **and** for the private staging directory to
//! be cleaned; a cleanup error is reported, not swallowed. A reply timeout
//! is not proof that a writer stopped: it never requests cleanup and keeps
//! the command tracked so a late acknowledgement still cleans up. An end
//! that arrives after a cancel was asked for is that confirmation (a
//! finish or a failure alike), and the cancellation's reason and cleanup
//! stand. A published file is never removed by a later cancel or end.
