//! Hardware key transitions, mounted capture rules and committed text for
//! custom Rust views and for TSX views.
//!
//! Desktops and browsers deliver [`KeyEvent`] notifications for the
//! focused view; app-rendered interaction surfaces can forward the logical
//! key, its DOM `code`, repeats and releases to their own input engine.
//! Linux also delivers [`TextInputEvent`] for text a key, a dead key or an
//! input method committed to a focused view that listens for it, and the
//! headless Linux driver commits the characters its generated key types.
//! The other platforms keep the API compiling and send none yet. Raw key
//! names are input data: the DOM's spelling for named keys, and the
//! character a printable key reports, never forced onto a made-up layout.
//! `code` is the source's physical identity in the DOM's spelling, mapped
//! by the backend from the native identifier it really has; a source
//! without one reports `""` and is never guessed from the logical key.
//! Named shortcuts remain [`crate::keymap`]'s responsibility.
//!
//! [`KeyCapture`] decides native consumption before callbacks run. Its keys
//! are canonical [`Keystroke`]s, so a capture shares the shortcut vocabulary
//! and normalization. The platform matches them against the transition's
//! canonical shortcut stroke, which its own shortcut matcher builds, never
//! against the event's `key` or `code`. Focus stays with the platform's
//! existing Tab and explicit-focus behavior.
