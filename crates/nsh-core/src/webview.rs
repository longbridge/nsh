//! A web view's downloads: the files its page saves, where an app chooses
//! they go, and the transport every platform speaks.
//!
//! An app that listens for [`crate::EventKind::DownloadPending`]
//! ([`crate::element::WebView::on_download_pending`]) chooses every
//! download's destination itself: the platform holds the transfer and
//! reports it as a [`WebDownloadPending`], whose [`accept`](WebDownloadPending::accept),
//! [`cancel`](WebDownloadPending::cancel) and
//! [`delegate`](WebDownloadPending::delegate) decide it. An app that listens
//! for [`crate::EventKind::Download`] alone ([`crate::element::WebView::on_download`])
//! has its downloads written into the app's data directory
//! (`downloads/<id>/<filename>`). With neither listener the platform keeps
//! its own behavior.
//!
//! A destination is a [`DownloadDestination`]: an absolute path whose
//! parent directory exists. It refuses an existing file unless
//! [`DownloadDestination::overwrite`] says to replace it. The core writes a
//! private staging directory beside the destination (its leaf does not
//! exist until the engine creates it) and publishes the file atomically
//! only when the transfer finishes, so a failed, cancelled or interrupted
//! download never replaces or corrupts a file at the destination; only the
//! private directory is removed, and only after the platform said its
//! writer stopped.
//!
//! Platforms are transports: they report offers, progress and ends
//! ([`DownloadOffer`], [`DownloadProgress`], [`DownloadEnd`]) and carry out
//! [`WebViewOperation`]s ([`crate::Command::WebViewRequest`]), answering
//! each with [`crate::EventKind::WebViewReply`] and [`reply`]. The state
//! machine, the timeouts, the destination checks, the files and the
//! app-facing events live in [`downloads`], on the engine thread; the disk
//! work runs on a thread of its own.
//!
//! [`WebDownload`] reports an automatic or accepted download's life
//! ([`WebDownloadControl`] cancels one that is under way). A download a
//! platform cannot own and the app did not delegate is reported as failed
//! with `ERR_NSH_DOWNLOAD_DISCARDED`.
