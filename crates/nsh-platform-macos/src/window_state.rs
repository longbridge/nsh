//! A window's state (`WindowRef.state()`, the main window's in the
//! environment's `window_state`), the displays (`displays()`) and the
//! requests that change the mode and the bounds, on AppKit.
//!
//! Each window is observed ([`Watch`]): a move, a resize,
//! (de)miniaturizing, entering or leaving full screen, a change of screen,
//! of key status and being ordered onto the screen or off it read its
//! state again. The main window's goes into the environment (the engine
//! holds a move back until the window stops); a window of the app's own
//! reports it on its root ([`crate::window::state_changed`]), a move or a
//! live resize once it settles. Every notification but a move's or a
//! resize's also moves the surface's display link to a window that shows
//! ([`Surface::follow_windows`]). The displays are `NSScreen.screens`, sent
//! to the engine before the app starts and again on
//! `NSApplicationDidChangeScreenParametersNotification`
//! ([`crate::system`]). Cocoa's screen coordinates go up from the primary
//! screen's bottom; NSH's go down from its top ([`to_bounds`]).
//!
//! AppKit keeps a zoomed window's frame from before the zoom to itself, so
//! the watch keeps the last frame it saw windowed: a maximized or full
//! screen window's placement. The frames a zoom animates through are not
//! windowed ones ([`will_zoom`]).
