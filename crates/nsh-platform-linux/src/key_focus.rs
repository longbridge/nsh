//! The keyboard focus on views: Tab moves it between the stops
//! ([`nsh_core::ViewProps::focus_stop`]) and fields, in GTK's own focus
//! chain; `focus()` moves it to a stop. A focused stop reports `FOCUSED`,
//! `onFocus` and `onBlur`, Return and Space press it, and Shift+F10 or the
//! Menu key ask it for its context menu.
//!
//! One key controller per window, in GTK's capture phase, decides a press
//! in this order: the app's shortcuts, the focused view's `KeyDown`
//! (reported to the engine, never waited for) with its `capture_keys` rules
//! ([`crate::keyboard`]), an active composition's input method, the
//! application menu's shortcuts ([`crate::chrome::menu_shortcut`]), the
//! defaults of this module and, last, ordinary text through the view's
//! input method. A view that hears raw keys runs the app's bindings itself,
//! once ([`crate::keymap::raw`]), and its shortcut's action skips that
//! press; other views leave the shortcuts to the app's
//! `ShortcutController`, as before. A captured key is reported
//! (`KeyEvent::default_prevented`) and runs none of the menu's shortcuts or
//! defaults: no traversal, activation, context menu or text. A key that
//! only listens runs them as before.
//!
//! A native popup (a context menu, the menu bar's menus, their nested
//! submenus) grabs the keyboard: its releases never reach the window's
//! controller. [`observe_popovers`] watches them where they are delivered,
//! so a release reaches the view focused now, as a browser reports a key
//! up on the focused element whichever view heard its press.
//!
//! Views stay unfocusable until Tab or `focus()` picks them: GTK also
//! hands the focus around by itself (to the first focusable widget as a
//! window maps, into a parent's children when a focused widget goes), and
//! a click or a new window must not land on a button.
