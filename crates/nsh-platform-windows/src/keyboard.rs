//! Keyboard focus for custom views, and the hardware key events they hear.
//!
//! Windows gives the keyboard to a text field NSH hosts or to a web view's
//! window; nothing else in a surface could take it. This module adds the
//! third case: a mounted view that is a focus stop
//! ([`nsh_core::ViewProps::focus_stop`]: `focusable`, or a view that takes
//! presses) takes the keyboard focus with Tab, a click, `ref.focus()` or
//! UI Automation. While it has the focus, the window's `WM_KEYDOWN` /
//! `WM_KEYUP` messages become [`nsh_core::KeyEvent`]s
//! ([`crate::surface::Surface::event`]): the engine bubbles both to the
//! view's listening ancestors within its native window.
//!
//! The logical key comes from the current keyboard layout
//! (`ToUnicodeEx`), never from a US layout guess; `code` is the DOM
//! `KeyboardEvent.code` of the message's scan code and extended bit, the
//! key's physical place on any layout (`""` when the message carries no
//! scan code, as input injected as text does). The keys are the same
//! shortcut keys [`crate::keymap`] matches (virtual keys, US letters under
//! non-Latin layouts), so a captured key is one the app can also bind.
//!
//! Capture rules ([`nsh_core::KeyCapture`]) are read from the mounted
//! props of the focused view and its enabled ancestors — walking
//! [`nsh_core::ViewProps::key_parent`] when core set one for a view a
//! native surface portals at a root it does not logically live under —
//! before the native defaults of [`crate::input::key`] (the application menu, a focused
//! field's editing, navigation, scrolling, Tab's traversal). A captured
//! key is still reported, with `default_prevented` set, and runs none of
//! those defaults. A captured key is never translated into characters:
//! [`suppress_translation`] runs from the thread's `WH_GETMESSAGE` hook
//! (and the standalone loop) before `TranslateMessage`, and turns the key
//! down into a private message the window procedure handles as the key
//! down it was. Nothing of the message queue is inspected, moved or
//! restamped, so a character queued around the key keeps its place and
//! its delivery.
//!
//! Focus is per native window (the main window's root, or the root of a
//! window of the app's own): a window in the background keeps its view, and
//! the keys of the window in front only reach its own. A modal presented
//! over a window saves the custom view with the focus, as it saves a
//! text field, and gives it back when it closes if that view is still a
//! shown, enabled stop. A view that is removed, concealed or disabled
//! loses the focus without a synthetic key release; releases are reported
//! when the source sends them, on whatever view has the focus then, and
//! repeats are what the message's previous-key-state bit says.
