//! The step `keyboard.press(<keys>)`: a key with its modifiers, as a
//! hardware keyboard gives it, on every platform (`open`'s `platform`: the
//! phones and tablets have one too, a tablet's keyboard, a Chromebook's).
//! The app's shortcuts (`nsh/keymap`) take it first, as the platforms'
//! keymaps do: the newest binding of the keystroke that fires where the
//! focus is reports `onKeyCommand`; Return and Space on a focused control
//! (in the newest modal over its window, if one shows) fire only the
//! focus' own bindings (`KeyOptions::for_focus`), else they press the
//! control. Then, on Linux (the simulated backend whose raw path
//! delivers input), a view that has the keyboard focus hears the press
//! (its `on_key_down` and its ancestors'), the capture rule of it or of an
//! enabled view around it deciding whether the platform keeps it
//! (`capture_keys`): a captured press types nothing and runs no default,
//! and the view focused when the source reports the release hears its
//! `KeyUp`. A press the platform keeps goes on to its defaults:
//! Return and Space press the focused control, then on a desktop the
//! application menu's item with that shortcut is chosen (`onMenu`); else
//! Tab moves the keyboard focus between the inputs and the views that are
//! its stops (those that take presses, and `focusable` ones that take none)
//! where the platform does (macOS, the web, Linux), Shift+F10 asks it for
//! its context menu (the web, Linux), the focused input takes the keys that
//! edit it, and Escape goes back.
